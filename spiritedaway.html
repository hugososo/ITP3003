        <summary>Introduction</summary>
        <p>Master animation director Hayao Miyazaki follows up on his record-breaking 1997 opus Princess Mononoke with
          this surreal Alice in Wonderland-like tale about a lost little girl. The film opens with ten-year-old Chihiro
          riding along during a family outing as her father races through remote country roads. When they come upon a
          blocked tunnel, her parents decide to have a look around -- even though Chihiro finds the place very creepy.
          When they pass through the tunnel, they discover an abandoned amusement park. As Chihiro's bad vibes continue,
          her parents discover an empty eatery that smells of fresh food. After her mother and father help themselves to
          some tasty purloined morsels, they turn into giant pigs. Chihiro understandably freaks out and flees. She
          learns that this very weird place, where all sorts of bizarre gods and monsters reside, is a holiday resort
          for the supernatural after their exhausting tour of duty in the human world. Soon after befriending a boy
          named Haku, Chihiro learns the rules of the land: one, she must work , as laziness of any kind is not
          tolerated; and two, she must take on the new moniker of Sen. If she forgets her real name, Haku tells her,
          then she will never be permitted to leave. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi</p>

          <div class="review-title">The best animated film I have ever seen</div>
          <div>Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them
            wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature,
            large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something
            truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house,
            stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and
            human-frog hybrids.
            The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no
            dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the
            Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist
            takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's
            just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.

          <div class="review-title">Strange, touching and beautiful</div>
          <div>Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical
            fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't
            want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of "otherness" to it - for lack of a
            better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the
            amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me.
            Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a
            certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something
            new. And a profoundly moving experience.
            Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I
            can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.

          <div class="review-title">Great</div>
          <div>Despite an overlong run time, Spirited Away is a visually stunning film filled with some of the most
            imaginative characters I've ever seen. In addition to the visuals, the music is beautiful, and the story has
            something for audience members of all ages.
